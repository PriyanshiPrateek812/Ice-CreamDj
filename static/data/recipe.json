            "description": "Indulge in the Vanilla Berry Temptation Cone! It’s a perfect blend of creamy, crunchy, and tart flavors, making it an irresistible treat! 🍦🍫🍓",
            "ingredients":"2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup + 2 TBSP sugar, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup butter (frozen or very cold), 1/2 cup sour cream or plain yogurt, 1 large egg, 1 TBSP good quality vanilla extract, 1 cup fresh blackberries (or any berry of your choice), washed and patted dry",
            "recipe":"Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Grate the cold butter into the flour mixture using a cheese grater (yes, it works wonders!). The mixture should resemble coarse meal. Add sour cream (or yogurt), egg, and vanilla. Mix gently until just combined. The dough will be sticky—don’t worry! Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Pat it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 triangular wedges (like a pizza). Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between them. Bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. Let them cool slightly, then enjoy with a dusting of powdered sugar or a drizzle of lemon icing."
